	Learning a programming language is oddly similar to learning a
	spoken language. If you don't practice you won't be able to use
	it.
	
	A common failure is to go too fast forward on the basic concepts
	and then get confused as it gets a bit more complicated. To
	prevent that situation, I'm goint to go through a tutorial book
	with exercises from the very beginning and hopefully up to the
	end.

	After looking and asking around I decided to choose 
	\emph{The C Programming Language} written by Brian W. Kerninghan
	and Dennis M. Ritchie.

	This document is giving the original exercise texts and my
	personal code as a solution for these exercises. 

	All the sources to this documentation as well as the sources
	for my solutions including the makefiles are accessible at
	my personal GitHub account at https://github.com/ninux/KnR.
